# SD403-Fishing-System-for-quadriplegics

NSF Project - Fishing System for Quadriplegics 
Problem Statement: Veterans returning from war, or others who sustained a catastrophic injury, may no longer be able to utilize their limbs, and therefore find it difficult to participate in recreational activities that they once enjoyed, such as fishing. This type of activity could be a critical stress reliever from the personâ€™s daily schooling or work activities. 

Proposed Technology: This project will entail the development of a system that allows a quadriplegic to cast and retrieve a fishing pole by himself/herself. 

Possible Solution: The developed system could consist of a mechanism (e.g., motors, linear actuators, springs, solenoids) to cast the fishing pole, retrieve it, and set the hook when a fish bites, all controlled through a standard sip and puff switch. 

Group Expertise Needed: 3-4 students including electrical hardware and software expertise, and some mechanical knowhow. 

This project is supported by a National Science Foundation grant, and therefore comes with a $2,700 budget for purchasing supplies.
